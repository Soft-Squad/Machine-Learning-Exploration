# Machine-Learning-Exploration
 ## Coursework for SENG474 - Data Mining
 
 ## Assignment 1
 Here are some of the main goals from my first assignment. Each Assignment will have its own README that explains in depth my assignments.
 
 ### Data cleaning:
The main learning goal was to understand the importance of data cleaning and preparation before conducting any analysis or modeling.
The specific task was to clean and preprocess a dataset containing information about Airbnb listings in New York City.
The cleaning process involved dealing with missing values, handling categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.

### Decision trees:
The main learning goal was to understand the basics of decision trees and their implementation from scratch using Python.
The specific task was to implement the ID3 algorithm for building a decision tree classifier and apply it to a dataset containing information about breast cancer tumors.
The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the decision tree included accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
The scikit-learn library was also introduced as an alternative method for building decision trees.

 ### Random forests:
The main learning goal was to understand the concept and implementation of random forests as an ensemble learning technique.
The specific task was to implement a random forest on a dataset containing information about poverty rates in the Philippines and compare its performance with a single decision tree.
The evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the random forest included training and test error plots, as well as statistics such as mean squared error and R-squared.

 ### Linear regression:
The main learning goal was to understand the concept and implementation of linear regression, including the closed-form solution and using scikit-learn for implementation.
The specific task was to apply linear regression to a dataset containing information about movie ratings, using the user rating to predict the critic's rating.
Other tasks included experimenting with polynomial regression and multiple regression, as well as applying ridge regression to all features in the dataset to predict the critic's rating.

### Cross-validation:
The main learning goal was to understand the concept and implementation of cross-validation for model selection and validation.
The specific task was to implement 5-fold cross-validation to select the best regression tree from a decision tree implementation on a poverty rate dataset.

### Feature transformation:
The main learning goal was to understand the importance of feature transformation in linear regression and how it can improve the accuracy of the model.
The specific task was to fit a line to a set of points using linear regression and then use feature transformation to achieve a perfect fit.
